#summary List of code conventions for the project.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Indentation =

Each indentation is 4 spaces. People using tabs will be shot (even though I like tabs (Kev)).

= Editor =

Hel likes using IDLE, so if you want the path of least resistance, use that :)

= Variable naming =

Variables shall be named in lowerCamelCase.

= Method naming =

Methods, shall be named in lowerCamelCase.

= Class naming =

All classes shall be named with a capital for each word. LikeThisClass.

= Documentation =
All methods, classes and member variables should be pydocced.
In-code comments generally imply badly written code - if you want to write a comment, write a method instead (Refactoring: improving the design of existing code (Martin Fowler)).
